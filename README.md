# Xenogears Map Viewer

The backbone of the Xenogears Map Viewer website is a script that loads the level files and and displays it using it's own OpenGL context  - basically it's a program you have to download and run every time to look at the level.
The original author included function to export the level to a standard 3D file format, but unfortunately it doesn't export everything. Mainly - all textures with transparency are distorted or straight up just black or white. I tried to fix that issue, but my skill in graphics programing isn't sufficient enough to solve this problem right now.

Still, what I wanted the most was ease of access, so how much people as possible could look at those maps - straight in their browsers, without the hassle of manually downloading files, launching programing scripts and such.
But I decided that I want people to also be able to look at the maps in their original best quality, so alongside the website I'll release the reworked, streamlined and user-friendly version of the script to download.
